<p id="description">PROBLEM STATEMENT: The video game industry is experiencing rapid growth with a diverse range of games being released across various platforms. However predicting the global sales of a video game is a challenging task due to the numerous factors influencing its success. To address this challenge the goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the global sales of video games based on various features such as platform year of release genre critic and user scores ratings and sales in different regions.
